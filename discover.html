            <p class="philosopy-text">
                Immaculada Concepcion College believes that affordable yet superior-quality education is possible and should be made available to all.<br><br>
                We distinguish ourselves by putting a premium on purposeful, responsible leadership skills that are hinged on excellence and integrity.<br><br>
                This culture of excellence is designed to develop among students a strong sense of themselves as individuals and as members of a community by which they are effectively prepared toward possessing a strong sense of self direction as they develop to be true champions in life.<br><br>
                Our educational system nurtures all areas of human developmentâ€”spiritual, moral, intellectual, emotional, social, physical and aesthetic--<br><br>
                through a healthy balance between a relevant, strong academic foundation and multi-disciplinary learning processes. This system offers students experiential learning that gives them an edge to be analytical thinkers.<br><br>
                This Institution recognizes that student success is fully realized when parents /guardians are actively involved in the learning process thus it encourages their active participation in their development.<br><br>
                It seeks to nurture individuals whose passion for learning will never fade as it aims to produce lifelong learners who will enthusiastically pursue personal and professional developments for the ultimate goal of positively contributing to their communities, country and the global society.<br><br>
